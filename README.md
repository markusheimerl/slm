A small language model implementation

Consider a character-level language model built on a state space model backbone with MLP projection, operating on character sequences of shape (seq_len Ã— batch_size). The architecture combines learned character embeddings with temporal state dynamics through SSM, followed by MLP transformation and softmax normalization for next-character prediction. The forward propagation follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
E_t &= W_E[X_t] \\
H_t &= E_tB^T + H_{t-1}A^T \\
O_t &= H_t\sigma(H_t) \\
Y_t &= O_tC^T + E_tD^T \\
Z_t &= Y_tW_1 \\
A_t &= Z_t\sigma(Z_t) \\
L_t &= A_tW_2 \\
P_t &= \frac{\exp(L_t)}{\sum_c \exp(L_{t,c})}
\end{align*}
$$

The embedding matrix $W_E$ maps discrete character indices to dense vector representations via indexing $W_E[X_t]$. The SSM processes embedded inputs through state transition matrix $A$, input matrix $B$, output matrix $C$, and feedthrough matrix $D$. The MLP then transforms SSM outputs through weight matrices $W_1$ and $W_2$ with Swish activation $z\sigma(z)$. Finally, softmax normalization produces probability distributions over the character vocabulary.

For language modeling, the cross-entropy loss between predicted and actual next characters is minimized, where $\odot$ denotes elementwise multiplication:

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathcal{L} &= -\frac{1}{T \cdot B}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\sum_{b=1}^{B} \log P_{t,b,y_{t,b}} \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial L_t} &= P_t - \mathbf{1}_{y_t} \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W_2} &= A_t^T(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial L_t}) \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial A_t} &= (\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial L_t})(W_2)^T \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Z_t} &= \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial A_t} \odot [\sigma(Z_t) + Z_t\sigma(Z_t)(1-\sigma(Z_t))] \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W_1} &= Y_t^T(\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Z_t}) \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Y_t} &= (\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Z_t})(W_1)^T
\end{align*}
$$

The gradient then flows backward through the SSM following standard BPTT with Swish derivatives:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial C} &= \sum_t (\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Y_t})^T O_t \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial D} &= \sum_t (\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Y_t})^T E_t \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial O_t} &= (\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Y_t})C \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial H_t} &= \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial O_t} \odot [\sigma(H_t) + H_t\sigma(H_t)(1-\sigma(H_t))] + (\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial H_{t+1}})A \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial A} &= \sum_t (\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial H_t})^T H_{t-1} \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial B} &= \sum_t (\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial H_t})^T E_t \\
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial W_E[c]} &= \sum_{\substack{t,b \\ X_{t,b}=c}} \left(B^T\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial H_t} + D^T\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial Y_t}\right)
\end{align*}
$$

where $\mathbf{1}_{y_t}$ denotes the one-hot encoding of target characters. The embedding gradients accumulate contributions from all occurrences of each character across the sequence.

During generation, the model maintains hidden state across timesteps and samples from the predicted character distribution using temperature-controlled sampling:

$$
P_{\tau}(c) = \frac{\exp(L_c / \tau)}{\sum_{c'} \exp(L_{c'} / \tau)}
$$

where temperature $\tau$ controls sampling entropy - $\tau \rightarrow 0$ approaches argmax sampling while $\tau > 1$ increases randomness.

The AdamW optimizer maintains exponential moving averages for all parameters $\theta = \{A, B, C, D, W_E, W_1, W_2\}$ with momentum $\beta_1$, second moment $\beta_2$, and weight decay $\lambda$. The learning rate is denoted by $\eta$, $t$ is the current training iteration, and $\epsilon$ is a small constant for numerical stability. For each weight matrix $W$, the update rule is:

$$
\begin{align*}
m &= \beta_1m + (1-\beta_1)(\frac{\partial L}{\partial W}) \\
v &= \beta_2v + (1-\beta_2)(\frac{\partial L}{\partial W})^2 \\
W &= (1-\lambda\eta)W - \eta\cdot\frac{m}{1-\beta_1^t}/\sqrt{\frac{v}{1-\beta_2^t} + \epsilon}
\end{align*}
$$

The implementation leverages CUDA for parallel computation across batch and sequence dimensions, with efficient kernel implementations for embedding lookup, Swish activation, softmax normalization, and gradient accumulation. Character sequences are extracted from text corpora through random position sampling, providing diverse training contexts.
